binary-search-tree
==================
This is an assignment I had to complete for a CS course.

Through it, I've learned:
* structured C programming
* memory managing
* GNU autotools
* check unit testing framework

The implementation differs a little from the assignment. It was asked to
implement a list of definition, but I thought it was simpler and more efficient
to store expression in definition that would be recursively constructed by
searching the tree.
